# XmlParsingTutorial
Parsing a Xml file,Finding the number of tags and reading their data and storing them into a database in the form of a table
This is a small independent module of a project to parse a xml file and store its data to the database.
To Parse the xml file dom parser is used and to perform operation on database(Mysql is Used here) jdbc driver is used.
Currently I am making this module more efficient and maintainable.
